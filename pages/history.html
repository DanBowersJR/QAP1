        <blockquote class="historyBlurb">
          The first generation Corvette, launched in 1953 as a two-seater sports
          car, featured Harley Earl's pioneering fiberglass body. Initially
          powered by a six-cylinder "Blue Flame" engine, performance improved
          significantly in 1955 with the optional 265 cubic inch V8. In 1957,
          the Corvette introduced a 283 cubic inch V8, including the "Fuelie"
          model, which delivered one horsepower per cubic inch. This generation,
          produced until 1962, set the foundation for the Corvette's future
          success.

        <blockquote class="historyBlurb">
          The second-generation Corvette, introduced in 1963, featured a modern,
          aggressive design and was offered as both a convertible and coupe.
          Powered by a big-block V8, it reached new performance heights with the
          L88 engine, officially rated at 430 horsepower but delivering much
          more. This marked a significant advancement in Corvette history.

          The third-generation Corvette, or C3, debuted in 1968 and was produced
          until 1982. It featured a more aerodynamic design with various body
          styles, including a T-top and hatchback. The L88 engine option,
          regarded as the "holy grail" of C3 production, was carried over from
          the previous generation.

          The fourth-generation Corvette, or C4, was introduced in 1984 and
          produced until 1996. It featured a modern design and a range of V8
          engines. Notably, the ZR-1 model used a DOHC all-aluminum LT-5 engine
          developed by Lotus, making it the only Corvette with a non-Chevrolet
          engine.

          boosting its appeal and value.
